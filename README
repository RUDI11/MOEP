MOEP, a clone of UNO, came to life as a school project in summer 2011
Its name is derived from the pronounciation of the Africaans word for "eine"

When finished, MOEP will support these features:
- All the features known from UNO like 2+, 4+, wish cards ...
- Playing with up to 3 players in a LAN
- Creating own servers within the client to start multiplay games easily
- Possibility to link in KIs while playing with friend(s)
- (Maybe) joining servers on the internet
